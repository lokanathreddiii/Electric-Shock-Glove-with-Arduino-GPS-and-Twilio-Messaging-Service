# Electric Shock Glove with Arduino, GPS, and Twilio Messaging Service ‚ö°üß§üõ∞Ô∏èüì±

This project is a combination of hardware and software, aiming to create an electric shock glove equipped with Arduino, GPS technology, and Twilio messaging service. This glove can be used for various applications, including personal safety, security, and emergency communication.

## Features

- **Electric Shock Capability**: The glove is equipped with electrodes capable of delivering an electric shock upon activation.
- **GPS Tracking**: Integrated GPS module enables real-time tracking of the glove's location.
- **Twilio Messaging Service**: Allows the glove to send SMS messages to predefined contacts in case of emergency.

## Components

- **Arduino Board**: Controls the functionality of the glove.
- **Electric Shock Circuit**: Includes electrodes and necessary components for generating electric shocks.
- **GPS Module**: Provides location tracking functionality.
- **Twilio Account**: Required for sending SMS messages.

## How It Works

1. **Electric Shock Activation**:
   - Upon user input or trigger, the Arduino activates the electric shock circuit, delivering a non-lethal electric shock to the target.
   
2. **GPS Tracking**:
   - The GPS module continuously tracks the location of the glove, providing real-time coordinates.
   
3. **Emergency Messaging**:
   - In case of emergency, the user can activate the Twilio messaging service by pressing a predefined button combination.
   - The glove sends an SMS message to predefined contacts, including the current GPS coordinates and a distress signal.

## Usage

1. **Power On**: Ensure the glove is powered on and properly connected to the Arduino.
2. **Activate Electric Shock**: Use the designated trigger to activate the electric shock functionality.
3. **GPS Tracking**: The glove continuously tracks its location and updates the coordinates.
4. **Emergency Alert**:
   - In case of emergency, activate the emergency messaging service by pressing the predefined button combination.
   - Contacts will receive an SMS message containing the distress signal and GPS coordinates.

## Safety Considerations

- **Use with Caution**: The electric shock capability of the glove can cause discomfort or injury if misused.
- **Keep Away from Water**: Avoid using the glove in wet or humid conditions to prevent electrical hazards.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Access**: Ensure the glove is not accessible to unauthorized users, especially children.

## Credits

- This project is inspired by the need for personal safety devices in various situations.
- Thanks to the Arduino community for providing resources and support for hardware projects.
- Twilio's messaging service adds an extra layer of emergency communication functionality.
